# rust-node-blank

**rust-node-blank:** Rust add-on example for Bun (Node-API via Neon)

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

## Installing rust-node-blank

Installing rust-node-blank requires Bun and a [supported version of Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

You can install the project with Bun. In the project directory, run:

```sh
$ bun install
```

This fully installs the project, including installing any dependencies and running the build.

## Building rust-node-blank

If you have already installed the project and only want to run the build, run:

```sh
$ bun run build
```

This command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust build and copy the built library into `./bin/addon.node`.

## Exploring rust-node-blank

After building rust-node-blank, you can explore its exports using Bun:

```sh
$ bun install
$ bun -e "const addon = require('./bin/addon.node'); console.log(addon.hello())"
hello from Rust
```

## Bun demos

After building the addon, you can run Bun demos from the `demos/` folder:

```sh
$ bun demos/hello.ts
$ bun demos/math.ts
$ bun demos/json.ts
$ bun demos/bun-fs.ts
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `bun install`

Installs the project, including running `bun run build`.

### `bun run build`

Builds the Node addon (`bin/addon.node`) from source.

### `bun run test`

Runs the unit tests by calling `cargo test`. You can learn more about [adding tests to your Rust code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Project Layout

The directory structure of this project is:

```
rust-node-blank/
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── bin/
|   └── addon.node
├── demos/
|   ├── bun-fs.ts
|   ├── hello.ts
|   ├── json.ts
|   └── math.ts
├── package.json
├── src/
|   └── lib.rs
└── target/
```

### Cargo.toml

The Cargo [manifest file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html), which informs the `cargo` command.

### README.md

This file.

### bin/addon.node

The Node addon—i.e., a binary Node module—generated by building the project. This is the main module for this package, as dictated by the `"main"` key in `package.json`.

Under the hood, a [Node addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) is a [dynamically-linked shared object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries). The `"build"` script produces this file by copying it from within the `target/` directory, which is where the Rust build produces the shared object.

### package.json

The package manifest file, used by Bun scripts and tooling.

### src/

The directory tree containing the Rust source code for the project.

### src/lib.rs

The Rust library's main module.

### target/

Binary artifacts generated by the Rust build.
